    <p> My name is Deniz Sagnaklar. I’m from Istanbul, Turkey and I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Northwestern University. In the past, I have worked as a software developer, a UI designer and as a coding tutor to help direct young girls to pursue STEM. I want to pursue a career in tech and want to work on expanding what technology can do for humans. I decided to study engineering because I’ve always been very intrigued by how humans can do so much today that they couldn’t do a few decades ago.</p>
